# LandersPack Block 5 Textures
Falcon 9 Block 5 textures for Launchers Pack mod for Kerbal Space Program

# Installation:
Just drag /Textures into Launchers Pack/Rockets/SpaceX and replace all (scripts to enable the textures) old textures still work, and if you already have custom textures for fairings (which i've included some of mine) add them to the fairing .cfg
