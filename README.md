# Launchers Pack Block 5 Textures
Falcon 9 Block 5 textures for Launchers Pack mod for Kerbal Space Program

# Installation:
Download Falcon 9 Block 5.zip and unpack
now,just drag the files in "B5 and new fairing textures" into Launchers Pack/Rockets/SpaceX and replace all (scripts to enable the textures) old textures still work, and if you already have custom textures for fairings (which i've included some of mine) add them to the fairing .cfg
