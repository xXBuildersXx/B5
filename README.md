# Launchers Pack Block 5 Textures
Falcon 9 Block 5 textures for Launchers Pack mod for Kerbal Space Program.

# Installation:
Download F9-HB5.zip and unpack. Now, just drag the files into the KSP Directory and replace all (scripts to enable the textures) old textures still work, and if you already have custom textures for fairings (which i've included some of mine) add them to the fairing .cfg
